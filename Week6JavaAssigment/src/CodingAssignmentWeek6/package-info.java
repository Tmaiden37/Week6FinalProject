//Create the following classes.
//	Card
//	Fields
//	value (contains a value from 2-14 representing cards 2-Ace)
//	name (e.g. Ace of Diamonds, or Two of Hearts)
//	Methods
//	Getters and Setters
//	describe (prints out information about a card)
//	Deck
//	Fields
//	cards (List of Card)
//	Methods
//	shuffle (randomizes the order of the cards)
//	draw (removes and returns the top card of the Cards field)
//	In the constructor, when a new Deck is instantiated, the Cards field should be populated with the standard 52 cards.
//	Player
//	Fields
//	hand (List of Card)
//	score (set to 0 in the constructor)
//	name
//	Methods
//	describe (prints out information about the player and calls the describe method for each card in the Hand List)
//	flip (removes and returns the top card of the Hand)
//	draw (takes a Deck as an argument and calls the draw method on the deck, adding the returned Card to the hand field)
//	incrementScore (adds 1 to the Player’s score field)
//	Create a class called App with a main method.
//	Instantiate a Deck and two Players, call the shuffle method on the deck.
//	Using a traditional for loop, iterate 52 times calling the Draw method on the other player each iteration using the Deck you instantiated.
//	Using a traditional for loop, iterate 26 times and call the flip method for each player.
//	Compare the value of each card returned by the two player’s flip methods. Call the incrementScore method on the player whose card has the higher value.
//	After the loop, compare the final score from each player. 
//	Print the final score of each player and either “Player 1”, “Player 2”, or “Draw” depending on which score is higher or if they are both the same.
